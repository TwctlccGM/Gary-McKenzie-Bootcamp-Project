      <p>
      I love playing games, watching games and making games. I learned some basic coding from 
      making several small projects in my free time in Game Maker Studio 2 which uses GML as it's 
      programming language. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Forest scene</h3>
    <p>   
	My Processing project is a 2D game which has utilised arrays, loops, randomness, 
	if/else statements and multiple classes. The goal of the game is to defeat the
	enemy triangle before it defeats you and before your time runs out.
	
	I have bugtested it thoroughly and polished it with slight animations, responsive 
	sounds and visual feedback. The sound of the enemy shooting and the animated 
	background can be toggled on or off during gameplay depending on the player's 
	preference. Controls are displayed on screen before gameplay begins.
